Hand Sign Recognition Using Custom Dataset

This project implements a Hand Sign Recognition system that uses a deep learning model trained on a customly created hand gesture dataset. It captures images of different hand signs, preprocesses the data, trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and performs real-time hand sign classification via webcam.

Features
Custom Dataset Creation: Collect hand gesture images through webcam input and organize them into labeled folders.

Data Preprocessing & Augmentation: Enhance dataset diversity with techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling.

Deep Learning Model: Train a CNN to accurately classify hand signs.

Real-Time Recognition: Recognize hand signs live through webcam video feed.

User-Friendly: Simple scripts for dataset collection, model training, and real-time testing.
